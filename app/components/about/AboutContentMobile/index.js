Memarian has composed for Emmy Award winning series such as <em>Project Runway</em>, <em>Top Chef</em>, HBO's <em>Project Greenlight</em>, TLC's <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em> and Bravo's <em>The Real Housewives</em> franchise for the past decade.  He graduated from Berklee College of Music as a guitar principal with a B.M. in composition in 2006, and is currently a PhD candidate in Musicology at Claremont Graduate University.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  With over twenty years of playing guitar, a decade of songwriting and producing songs for feature films and composing for internationally syndicated television and advertisement, Aliâ€™s extensive list of credits is only matched by his passion for imparting the enthusiasm for music he still feels every time he picks up a guitar or heads into the studio. </p>
